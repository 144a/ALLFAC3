Damn, this one took waaaaay too many tries, but i think i have something that looks somewhat professional. I have to say, I'm actually pretty proud of this one. It definitely took more time than I was anticipating. It really did help out during Algebra 2 though. Factoring was always something I sucked at. The program can take in a string input, so you're basically typing in the problem like it is on paper. It also will return a nice looking answer. However, this program will only factor out linear factors, so things like the product of 2 irreducible 2nd degree polynomials will not factor. If the Polynomial was not factor-able (or has a non factor-able part), the program will find the roots of the entire polynomial, as long as all parts of the factored (or partially-factored) answer are of 4th degree or below.
